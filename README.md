Assuming you have a Unity application set up already that is able to operate on a headset, the comms.cs script can be attached to the game to provide the communications neccessary for the Lidar-AR-System to function. Once the script is attached, you will be able to define relevant variables in the inspector tab. For the "Headset Transform", please select "CenterEyeAnchor". For the "Server IP Address", please enter the IP address of the computer that you are running the Lidar-AR-System launch.py file from. Ensure both devices are on the same network and are set to "unprotected" if needed. The server port will default to 8888 and does not need to be changed.
